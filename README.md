This repository provides three different deeper network on image classification tasks: VGG, ResNet, DenseNet on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.

In this work we perform and evaluate image classification tasks in terms of model configuration comparison, training, validation and testing losses and error rate.

We also provide improvement on all models by using data augmentation, Dropout and batch-normalization.

Our results are shown as below
